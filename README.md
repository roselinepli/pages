## Django Pages App
<p>This repository contains a Pages application built using Django. The application includes
  a homepage and an about page. We've utilized class-based views and templates as the building blocks for 
  this project, and we've explored URLs more fully. Additionally, we've added basic tests and deployed the application on Heroku.</p>

## Features
<ul>
<li>Homepage: The homepage displays a simple welcome message to users.</li>

<li>About Page: The about page provides information about the website or organization.</li>

<li>Class-Based Views: The application uses class-based views to handle the logic for the homepage and about page.</li>

<li>Templates: We've used templates to create the HTML structure for the homepage and about page, separating the presentation from the logic.</li>

<li>URL Configuration: URLs are properly configured to direct users to the appropriate views.</li>

<li>Testing: Basic tests are included to ensure the functionality of the views.</li>
</ul>
